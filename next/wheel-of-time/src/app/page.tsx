        The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legends fade to myth, and
        even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the third age by
        some, an Age yet to come, an age long pass, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the
        beginning. There are neither beginnings or endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.
